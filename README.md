# Disaster Response Pipeline Project

<a id='overview'></a>

## 1. Project Overview

In this project, I'll apply data engineering to analyze disaster data from "Figure Eight" to build a model for classifies disaster messages.

_data_ directory contains a data set which are real messages that were sent during disaster. The task is to create a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that appropriate disaster relief agency can be reached out for help.

This project will include a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. Also, it has visualization related with.

## 2. Project Components

There are three components of this project:

1. ETL Pipeline

    File _data/process_data.py_ contains data cleaning pipeline that:
    
2. ML Pipeline

    File _models/train_classifier.py_ contains machine learning pipeline
    
    
3. Flask Web App


### Instructions to run:

1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl models/vocabulary_stats.pkl models/category_stats.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/
